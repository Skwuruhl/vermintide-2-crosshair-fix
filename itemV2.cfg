description = "Fixes the crosshairs to actually be representative of your spread.

[h1]Note: Does not alter spread in any way. Only changes crosshairs.[/h1]

In vanilla crosshairs are a static size on your screen not accounting for your custom FOV. They also don't account for some other math related to 2d projection of a 3d space (i.e. your monitor).
As you can see from the images this mod makes it so the crosshairs show the same (and correct) amount of spread regardless of your set FOV. (Example images are 120 and 45)

Warning: Very likely incompatible with other crosshair mods.";
