description = "Fixes the crosshairs to actually be representative of your spread.

[h1]Note: Does not alter spread in any way. Only changes crosshairs.[/h1]

In vanilla crosshairs are a static size on your screen not accounting for your custom FOV. They also don't account for some other math related to 2d projection of a 3d space (i.e. your monitor).
As you can see from the images this mod makes it so the crosshairs show the same (and correct) amount of spread regardless of your set FOV. (Example images are 120 and 45)

Warning: Very likely incompatible with other crosshair mods. Willing to work on compatability however.

More in depth explanation: What vanilla specifically does is assume that 15° of spread is equal to 228 pixels of spread on a 1080p monitor. This ignores that the pixels of spread will change depending on your field of view.

It also assumes that 5° of spread will be equal to 228/3 pixels of spread. This ignores that degrees and pixels aren't a linear relation since it's a 3d space being projected to a 2d image.

Mod makes crosshairs scale using the tangent function as 1080 * tan(spread/2)/tan(fov/2) to get a radius to place the crosshairs away from the center of the screen. Math is similar to my customizable sensitivity mod: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1498189723";
